### Compilation
Before compiling, make sure you are running the correct version of kernel. We are using Kernel v. 4.14.25. You can check which version you are using with the command *uname -a*.

Next switch to super user. Use the command *sudo -s*.
Navigate to our src folder. Execute compile.sh using any of the following commands.
*./compile.sh*
*sudo ./compile.sh*
*sh compile.sh*
If even as root user permission is still denied, you must execute *chmod +x compile.sh* to give root (or whatever your super username is) access to opening this file. For this reason, we recommend simply using the last command *sh* as it does not require adding extra permissions.
