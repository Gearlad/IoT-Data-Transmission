### Compilation
Before compiling, make sure you are running the correct version of kernel. We are using Kernel v. 4.14.25. You can check which version you are using with the command <em>uname -a</em>.

Next switch to super user. Use the command <em>sudo -s</em>.
Navigate to our src folder. Execute compile.sh using any of the following commands.
<p><em>./compile.sh<br>
    sudo ./compile.sh<br>
    sh compile.sh</em>
</p>
If even as root user permission is still denied, you must execute <em>chmod +x compile.sh</em> to give root (or whatever your super username is) access to opening this file. For this reason, we recommend simply using the last command <em>sh</em> as it does not require adding extra permissions.
