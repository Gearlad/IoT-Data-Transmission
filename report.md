# Project Report

## Design
The entire framework runs on Linux's mmap (memory map) library. mmap is pretty much a function for allocating memory on the heap. It's called by C's malloc() function, for example. Cool stuff.<br>
So the basic idea is, we're comparing the speed of mmap with normal file I/O.<br>
